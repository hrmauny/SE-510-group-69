"Workload is spread over the whole team (one team member is often Xtimes more productive than the others...but nevertheless, here is a track record that everyone is contributing a lot)",,3,
,,,
Number of commits,475 commits in repo https://github.com/atharva1996/Simplii/commits/main,3,
Number of commits: by different people,,2,Some people have done way more commits than others
Issues reports: there are many,24 issues in total,2,"A lot of issues were reported however, the issues were not documented in proper way (no description)"
Issues are being closed,2 issues closed out of 24,1,Quite a few issues 
DOI badge: exists,,3,
"Docs: doco generated, format not ugly",in GH: https://github.com/deekay2310/Simplii/tree/main/docs,3,
Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation),https://github.com/atharva1996/Simplii/blob/main/docs/Component%20Description.pdf,3,
"Docs: how: for common use cases X,Y,Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X,Y,Z",,3,separate video for each feature explaining what it does
"Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing",,3,The project description does start on an exciting note and something that everyone can relate which kind of motivates to use the application
"Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.",,2,The Description did have some images and short video but no animation or interative demonstration
Use of version control tools,,3,
Use of style checkers,https://github.com/deekay2310/Simplii/blob/main/.github/workflows/style_checker.yml ,2,
Use of code formatters.,https://github.com/deekay2310/Simplii/blob/main/.github/workflows/code_formatter.yml,3,
Use of syntax checkers., https://github.com/deekay2310/Simplii/blob/main/.github/workflows/syntax_checker.yml,3,
Use of code coverage,"code coveage of 68% present https://github.com/ivbhatt/Simplii/blob/main/docs/lintingEvidence/app.pyLinting.png, ",2,
Other automated analysis tools,https://github.com/deekay2310/Simplii/blob/main/.github/workflows/close_as_a_feature.yml,3,
Test cases exist,https://github.com/deekay2310/Simplii/tree/main/test,3,test for most of the features present
Test cases are routinely executed,https://github.com/deekay2310/Simplii/blob/main/.travis.yml,3,
The files CONTRIBUTING.md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up,,3,"A detailed guide on code of conduct, reporting of bugs, making pull request, tips provided in contributing.md file."
Issues are discussed before they are closed,,1,"no discussion before closing the issues, only one person was assigned for closure"
Chat channel: exists, https://discord.gg/jFWP5v2C,3,issue for adding a dicussion channel is present but not resolved hence no chat channel exists
Test cases: a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases.,,3,
Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files,,3,We can clearly see that entire codebase has been written in Python(https://github.com/ivbhatt/Simplii/search?l=python) and JavaScript(https://github.com/ivbhatt/Simplii/search?l=javascript). Everyone has the same access to the repository and also have equal access to comitting directly to the main branch.
"Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)",,2,"All team members are making use of PyCharm, Github Desktop, etc"
"Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer)",,3,
Evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base,,2,many people who have contributted to the project have repeatedly worked on the same thing (many commits on same file). But all collaborators have worked on wide variety of things
